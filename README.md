A project by **Benjamin Zhang** [zenbhang] and **Matt Schultz** [mschultz6]

Mouse Phone is a project that started as a stupid joke. The combination of late night work and badly written CSCI lab assignments resulted in this idea. The idea is this: make an app that allows the user to use a phone as a mouse.
